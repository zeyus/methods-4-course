# Methods 4: Bayesian Computational Modelling


## Overview

This course wraps up the series of methods courses. We look at modelling from a birds-eye view, introducing advanced concepts and revisiting methods introduced in earlier courses from a comprehensive Bayesian perspective. We introduce causal reasoning using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), mixture models, Gaussian processes, learn to deal with measurement error and missing data; and we revisit regression modelling, generalized linear models, multilevel modelling, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, learning to implement them using probabilistic programming.

## Materials and Literature

The course is based on the textbook *Statistical Rethinking* (2nd edition, 2020) by Richard McElreath<sup>1</sup>. Please get a copy. The book's [homepage](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) contains lots of additional resources. In particular, please install the [R package `rethinking`](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking). Slides and recordings of [the author's current course](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) and of a [previous version](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) from 2019 are also available.
